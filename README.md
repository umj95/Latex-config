# Latex-config
Personal LaTeX setup: style-file for packages, fonts, etc. and config-file for variables and custom title pages etc. to fit my whims and needs

The custom-style.sty file contains commonly loaded packages, the hyperref-setup, etc.

The config.tex-file contains all the variables for handing in a academic term paper, as well as setups for custom titlepage, anti-plagiarism declaration, works cited etc.

The commands (re-)defined so far are:
- \maketitle
- \maketitlepage
- \workscited
- \tableofcontents
- \plagiat
